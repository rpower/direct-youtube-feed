# Direct YouTube feeds

This script generates a series of RSS feeds which direct you straight to the video files rather than being directed to the video player page itself.

Put YouTube channel links in a list in `channels_ids.txt` (an example file is provided `channel_ids_EXAMPLE.txt`).

Files are produced in a `feeds` folder, one per channel.
